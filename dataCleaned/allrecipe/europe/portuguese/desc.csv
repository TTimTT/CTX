Set the bowl in a warm, draft-free place for 8 to 10 minutes, or until yeast doubles in volume. Pulverize the cornmeal in a blender until fine. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup cornmeal, salt, and boiling water. Stir vigorously until smooth. Stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Cool mixture to lukewarm. Stir proofed yeast into the cornmeal mixture. Gradually add 1/2 cup cornmeal and flour. Gather the dough into a ball, and place it in a greased bowl. Cover. Set it aside in a warm place for about 30 minutes, or until doubled in bulk. With a pastry brush, coat the bottom and sides of a 9 inch pie pan with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Turn the dough out into pie pan, and cover. Let it rise in a warm place for another 30 minutes, or until it doubles in bulk again.

Wash the clams, discarding any that are open. Add them to the onion/tomato mixture. Cover, and cook over high heat until all clams have opened, about 5 minutes, then cook for another minute. Meanwhile, drain the pork; set marinade aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons margarine in a large frying pan over medium heat. Cook pork until brown on all sides. Stir in marinade, and cook until there is very little liquid left. Keep turning pork or it will stick and burn! Serve the pork, the clams in their shells, and the onion mixture with boiled potatoes. Sprinkle everything with coriander and parsley, and garnish with lemon quarters.

Melt the butter and heat the olive oil in a large, heavy cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Discard marinade, and place tuna steaks in the skillet. Fry 2 1/2 minutes on each side, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork. Remove from skillet and drain on paper towels. Mix 1/4 cup pimenta moida, ketchup, 1/4 cup cider vinegar, water, 2 tablespoons hot paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/3 teaspoon pepper, and 1 tablespoon garlic powder into the skillet.

ed8f7dbcaceae82ad0614fa37b6f9f54£ Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, salt, orange juice and sugar. Use an electric mixer to beat the mixture until it is extremely thick. If you have a whisk attachment, it will work well for this. To test if the mixture is ready, shake the bowl. If the meringue barely moves, or doesn&#39;t move at all, it is ready. If not, keep on mixing. Spoon evenly sized mounds of the meringue, about 1 tablespoon, onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the edges are light brown all the way around. Handle them very gently, they are delicate. Allow to cool on the baking sheet. Remove to a large platter, and serve them to your big Portuguese family. 
906cde17dd9213e6ec5a177dd19b1d4d£ Warm the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, add the onion and garlic; cook and stir until golden brown.

a0b09cc85dcf3ba0852be89a6f76600e£ Wash, peel, and core the quinces, reserving the cores and peels. Coarsely chop the flesh and transfer the fruit to a large pan. Wrap the cores and peels in cheesecloth, tie the bag with kitchen string, and add it to the pan. (The peels contain most of the fruit&#39;s pectin, which contributes to the firmness of the quince paste.) Pour in enough water to cover the quinces and boil, half-covered, for 30 to 40 minutes or until the fruit is very soft. Remove the bag of peels and pass the quince flesh through a sieve or food mill. (For best results, don&#39;t use a food processor as it will result in too fine a texture.) You should have about 2 1/2 pounds of fruit pulp. Transfer the quince pulp to a saucepan and add the sugar (ideally, you should add the same amount of sugar, by weight, as the fruit pulp). Cook and stir over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Continue cooking for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the paste becomes very thick and has a deep orange color. Draw the wooden spoon along the bottom of the saucepan: it should leave a trail and the quince mixture will stick to the spoon. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish or line it with greased parchment paper. Transfer the quince paste to the baking dish, spreading it about 1 1/2-inch thick. Smooth the top and allow it to cool. Dry the paste on your lowest oven setting, no more than 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), for about 1 1/2 hours. Allow the quince paste to cool completely before slicing. (In Europe, the traditional method of drying the quince paste is to leave it in a cupboard for about 7 days. The remaining juices will continue to evaporate and render a drier paste.) Store quince paste in an airtight container in the refrigerator; the color will deepen with age. 
881a1098b3b6c5a6c1c762d1f2ba892a£ Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.

Form into a ball again, and cut the ball in half; cut each half into half again (4 pieces); cut each quarter into thirds to make 12 total pieces. Roll the pieces into balls, and set aside. Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, cream, milk, and vanilla extract in a bowl until light and foamy, about 3 minutes; strain the filling through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl. Press a dough ball into the bottom and about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of a prepared muffin cup; repeat for remaining dough pieces. Spoon each crust about 80 percent full of the egg yolk mixture.
