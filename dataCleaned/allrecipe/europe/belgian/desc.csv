Using your fingers, press dough firmly into the mold. Trim any excess dough from the mold with a knife. Transfer the cookies onto greased cookie sheets with a spatula, spacing about one inch apart. Refrigerate dough trimming to be rerolled later. Lightly flour but do not re-oil cookie mold. Repeat process with remaining dough.

You have to work in all five pounds of flour little by little by hand. It will work in but it takes a while. You&#39;ll wind up with a BIG mixing bowl of dough. Refrigerate dough overnight. Have plenty of people to help with the cooking. Lightly grease and heat the empty cookie iron over a gas burner. Start with a tablespoon and a half of dough rolled into a little &quot;cigar&quot; shape and vary amount to fit the size of your cookie iron. It takes from one to one and a half minutes to cook each cookie - it&#39;s a trial and error process at first till you get a handle on the temperature of the gas burner and the heat retaining capabilities of your iron. A properly cooked cookie will be golden and after cooled, crisp. This a family holiday tradition for us and we spend a whole day cooking cookies with lots of testing to make sure they&#39;re as good as last year&#39;s. The cast iron cookie irons work best, but I have seen people make them with the aluminum pizelle &quot;irons&quot;. Ask for a krumkokie (croom cockie) iron at a gourmet cooking shop. We put them in tins and store till next Christmas, eating last year&#39;s cookies.

7ac4033064815b58cb6b454f1e1c4e89£ To prepare the mussels, scrape off anything living or growing on the outside of the shells, and pull out the little bunch of dark hairs (the beard) coming out of the side of the shells. Soak them in cold water while doing so. The shells are usually closed when you buy them. Do not panic if they open under water! Any shells that do not close when you tap them, have to be thrown out. This part may be done a couple of hours ahead of time if the mussels are stored in a cool place. Set the cleaned mussels aside. In a large heavy-bottomed pot, combine the carrot, onion, celery, bay leaf, peppercorns, lemon slices and white wine. Bring to a boil over high heat, and add 1/3 of the cleaned mussels. Cover the pan, and cook shaking, every minute or so to help the mussels cook evenly. When all of the mussels are open, remove from the pan using a slotted spoon, and start enjoying your meal. Continue to cook remaining mussels in the same liquid.
