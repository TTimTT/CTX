Ideas for the website:

- Modal:
	1. Screenshot of one of the html original pages[X]
	2. Ingredients graph (holoviews network graph ?)
	3. Cooking time on map 
	4. Nutritional values on map
	5. Nutritional values (statistical boxplot)


Analysis:
[1]    Ingredient occurences distribution -> Word Cloud [X]
[2]    Link between regions -> Network on map?/ chord diagram: Taking for each countries the 50 most frequent ingredient and compare between each countries -> get the correlation if two ingredients exists in both, then it adds a weight of one [Pending]
[3]    Cooking Time -> Map of the world
[4]    Nutrition -> Get output to HTML and/or Map | try to link boxplot and map?


Website structure:
- Project description ( blabla + sample image of website)
